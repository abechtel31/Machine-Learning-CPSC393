Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby

Oh, baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here?
Oh, baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight, yeah

Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby
'Cause I need to know now, oh, because

My loneliness
Is killing me and I
I must confess
I still believe, still believe
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

Oh, baby, baby
The reason I breathe is you
Boy, you got me blinded
Oh, pretty baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it

Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby
'Cause I need to know now, oh, because

My loneliness
Is killing me and I
I must confess
I still believe, still believe
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
Ah, yeah, yeah

Oh, baby, baby
How was I supposed to know?
Oh, pretty baby
I shouldn't have let you go

I must confess
That my loneliness
Is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here
And give me a sign?
Hit me, baby, one more time

My loneliness
Is killing me and I
I must confess
I still believe, still believe
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

I must confess
That my loneliness
Is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here
And give me a sign?
Hit me, baby, one more time

Crazy,
I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Crazy,
But it feels alright
Every day and every night

You drive me crazy (you drive me crazy, baby)
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Oh... crazy,
(you make me feel alright)
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night

You drive me crazy (you drive me crazy, baby)
Oh... crazy (you make me feel alright)
But it feels alright
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night

You drive me crazy
I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Oh... crazy,
But it feels alright
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night

Tell me, you're so into me
That I'm the only one you will see
Tell me, I'm not in the blue,
That I'm not wastin' my feelings on you

Lovin' you means so much more.
More than anything I ever felt before

Baby, I'm so into you
You got that somethin'. What can I do?
Baby, you spin me around
The earth is movin' but I can't feel the ground

Every time you look at me
My heart is jumpin', it's easy to see

Lovin' you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
And I try, and I try, and I try, and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no satisfaction

When I'm drivin' in my car
And that man comes on the radio
And he's tellin' me more and more
About some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination
I can't get no, oh no no no
Hey hey hey, this what I say

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no reaction
And I try, and I try, and I try, and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no satisfaction

When I'm watchin' my TV
and that girl comes on to tell me
how tight my skirts should be
well she can't tell me who to be
cause I've got my own identity.
I can't get no, oh no no no

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction

Superstar
Where you from? How's it going?
I know you got a clue what you're doing?
You can play brand new to all the other chicks out here,
But I know what you are, what you are, baby

Look at you getting more than just a re-up
Baby, you got all the puppets with their strings up
Faking like a good one, but I call 'em like I see 'em
I know what you are, what you are, baby

Womanizer, woman—womanizer
You're a womanizer, oh, womanizer, oh
You're a womanizer, baby
You, you, you are, you, you, you are
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer, womanizer

Boy, don't try to front
I, I know just, just what you are, are, are
Boy, don't try to front
I, I know just, just what you are, are, are
You got me goin'
You're, oh, so charmin'
But I can do it
Womanizer

Boy, don't try to front
I, I know just, just what you are, are, are
Boy, don't try to front
I, I know just, just what you are, are, are
You say I'm crazy
I got your "crazy"
You're nothin' but a womanizer

Daddy-O
You got the swagger of a champion
Too bad for you
You just can't find the right companion
I guess when you have one too many, makes it hard
It could be easy, who you are
That's just who you are, baby

Lollipop
Must mistake me, you're a sucker
To think that I would be a victim not another
Say it, play it how you wanna
But no way I'm ever gonna fall for you, never you, baby

Womanizer, woman—womanizer
You're a womanizer, oh, womanizer, oh
You're a womanizer, baby
You, you, you are, you, you, you are
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer, womanizer

Boy, don't try to front
I, I know just, just what you are, are, are
Boy, don't try to front
I, I know just, just what you are, are, are
You got me goin'
You're, oh, so charmin'
But I can do it
You womanizer

Boy, don't try to front
I, I know just, just what you are, are, are
Boy, don't try to front
I, I know just, just what you are, are, are
You say I'm crazy
I got your "crazy"
You're nothin' but a womanizer

Maybe if we both lived in a different world
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer, womanizer
It would be all good,
And maybe I could be your girl,
But I can't 'cause we don't

Womanizer, woman—womanizer
You're a womanizer, oh, womanizer, oh
You're a womanizer, baby
You, you, you are, you, you, you are
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer, womanizer

I'm Miss American Dream since I was 17
Don't matter if I step on the scene
Or sneak away to the Philippines
They're still gon' put pictures of my derrière in the magazine
You want a piece of me
You want a piece of me

I'm Miss Bad Media Karma
Another day another drama
Guess I can't see the harm
In working and being a mama
And with a kid on my arm
I'm still an exceptional earner
You want a piece of me

I'm Mrs. Lifestyles Of The Rich And Famous
(You want a piece of me)
I'm Mrs. Oh My God That Britney's Shameless
(You want a piece of me)
I'm Mrs. Extra! Extra! This Just In
(You want a piece of me)
I'm Mrs. She's Too Big Now She's Too Thin
(You want a piece of me)

I'm Mrs. You Want A Piece Of Me
Tryin' and pissin' me off
Well get in line with the paparazzi
Who's flippin' me off
Hopin' I'll resort to some havoc
End up settlin' in court
Now are you sure you want a piece of me?

I'm Miss American Dream since I was 17
Don't matter if I step on the scene
Or sneak away to the Philippines
They're still gon' put pictures of my derrière in the magazine
You want a piece of me
You want a piece piece of me
You want a piece of me

It's Britney Bitch
I see you,
And I just wanna dance with you

Every time they turn the lights down
Just wanna go that extra mile for you
Your public display of affection
Feels like no one else in the room (but you)

We can get down like there's no one around
We keep on rocking, we keep on rockin'
Cameras are flashing while we're dirty dancing
They keep watching, keep watchin'
Feels like they're probably saying

Gimme gimme more
Gimme more
Gimme gimme more
Gimme gimme more
Gimme more
Gimme gimme more
Gimme gimme more
Gimme more
Gimme gimme more
Gimme gimme more
Gimme more
Gimme gimme more

The center of attention
(Do you feel this?)
Even when we're up against the wall
You got me in a crazy position
If you're on a mission
You got my permission

We can get down like there's no one around
We keep on rocking, we keep on rockin'
Cameras are flashing while we're dirty dancing
They keep watching, keep watchin'
Feels like they're probably saying

Gimme gimme more
Gimme more
Gimme gimme more
Gimme gimme more
Gimme more
Gimme gimme more
Gimme gimme more
Gimme more
Gimme gimme more
Gimme gimme more
Gimme more
Gimme gimme more

I just can't control myself

Well I'll give them more

Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme

Bet you didn't see this one coming
The Incredible Lago (more, more, more)
The legendary Miss Britney Spears
And the unstoppable Danja
Ah, you gonna have to remove me
'Cause I ain't going nowhere
